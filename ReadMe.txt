If you come across a bug, please post about it in the Corsair User Forums Thread:
For feature requests, post in my Corsair User Forums Thread:
Keep in mind, I am not an advanced programmer. New features may or may not be implemented simply because I don't know enough C++
If you modify this code, feel free to share it. I ask you to please credit me in proportion to the code you borrowed. (i.e. "This program is a heavily modified version of the original Binary Clock created by Jkraghify. I optimised everything he couldn't, so basically it's an entirely new program")
